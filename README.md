To get notifications when data is inserted into a database table from a .NET Console application, you can follow these general steps:

Database Setup: Ensure your database is set up to support notifications. For SQL Server, you can use features like SQL Server Service Broker or SQL Dependency to receive notifications.

Implement Notification Logic: Use a .NET library or API to handle notifications. For SQL Server, you can use SqlDependency to receive notifications when the data in your database changes.

Here’s a step-by-step example using SqlDependency for a SQL Server database:

1. Set Up SQL Server for Notifications
Make sure you have a Service Broker enabled for the database you are working with. You can enable it using:

sql
Copy code
ALTER DATABASE [YourDatabase] SET ENABLE_BROKER;
2. Create the Table and Populate It
Here's an example table and some sample data:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE NotificationsExample (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY,
    Data NVARCHAR(100)
);

INSERT INTO NotificationsExample (Data) VALUES ('Initial Data');
3. Write the .NET Console Application
You need to install the System.Data.SqlClient package if you haven't already. You can add it using NuGet:

sh
Copy code
dotnet add package System.Data.SqlClient
Here’s a simple example of a .NET Console application using SqlDependency:

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

namespace SqlDependencyExample
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Connection string to your SQL Server database
            string connectionString = "Server=your_server;Database=YourDatabase;Integrated Security=true;";

            // Set up the dependency
            SqlDependency.Start(connectionString);

            // Set up the SqlConnection and SqlCommand
            using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
            {
                connection.Open();

                using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SELECT Id, Data FROM NotificationsExample", connection))
                {
                    // Set up the SqlDependency
                    SqlDependency dependency = new SqlDependency(command);
                    dependency.OnChange += new OnChangeEventHandler(OnDataChange);

                    // Execute the command to establish the dependency
                    using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())
                    {
                        while (reader.Read())
                        {
                            Console.WriteLine($"{reader["Id"]}: {reader["Data"]}");
                        }
                    }
                }
            }

            // Keep the application running to listen for changes
            Console.WriteLine("Listening for changes. Press any key to exit...");
            Console.ReadKey();

            // Clean up the dependency
            SqlDependency.Stop(connectionString);
        }

        private static void OnDataChange(object sender, SqlNotificationEventArgs e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Data changed!");
            // Optionally, you could re-run the command to get updated data
        }
    }
}
Key Points:
SqlDependency.Start and SqlDependency.Stop: These methods start and stop the dependency monitoring for notifications.
SqlDependency: This object is used to subscribe to changes in the data.
OnChange Event Handler: This method is called when the data changes. You can handle the data change event and update your application accordingly.
Notes:
Ensure your SQL Server has the necessary permissions and configurations to send notifications.
SqlDependency works with SQL Server only and may require specific configurations to work properly in different environments or with different database setups.
With this setup, your console application should notify you when changes occur in the monitored table.
